    framework: "RTF",

    description: `
RTF is a precision framework designed to minimize ambiguity while keeping prompts short.
It works by constraining the model's perspective (Role), defining exactly what it should do (Task),
and eliminating guesswork about output shape (Format).

RTF is ideal when you already know what you want and speed matters more than exploration.
`,

      "Tasks with clear success criteria",

Role: Specify the expertise or viewpoint the model should adopt
Task: Define the exact action to perform
Format: Constrain length, structure, or style of the output
`,
    example: `
Role: Senior B2B SaaS copywriter
Task: Write a follow-up email to a prospect who attended a demo but hasn’t replied
Format: 5 sentences, professional but friendly tone, end with a single clear CTA

  costar: {
    framework: "COSTAR",
    title: "Context · Objective · Style · Tone · Audience · Response",
    description: `
COSTAR is a high-fidelity content framework optimized for situations where nuance, voice,
and audience alignment matter. It reduces misalignment by making implicit expectations explicit.

This framework shines in marketing, branding, public communication, and any scenario
where “how it sounds” is as important as “what it says.”
`,

Context: Background, constraints, and situation
Objective: What success looks like
Style: Reference examples or writing conventions
Tone: Emotional quality (e.g., confident, empathetic)
Audience: Who the content is for
Response: Desired format and length
`,
    example: `
Context: A mindfulness app competing with Headspace
Objective: Convince therapists to recommend the app to clients
Style: NYTimes health section
Tone: Credible, respectful, non-salesy
Audience: Licensed therapists (LCSW, 30–60)
Response: One-page persuasive overview with bullet sections

  tot: {
    framework: "Tree of Thoughts",
    title: "Multi-path reasoning and evaluation",
    description: `
Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is designed for complex problems where a single linear chain
of reasoning is insufficient. Instead of committing early, the model explores multiple
distinct approaches, evaluates them, and then deepens the strongest path.

This framework is especially useful for strategy, architecture decisions, and
high-stakes trade-off analysis.

      "Simple or well-scoped tasks",
      "Time-constrained scenarios",
      "Situations where exploration adds little value"
    ],
    structure: `
1. Generate multiple distinct approaches
2. Evaluate each against explicit criteria
3. Select the strongest option
4. Continue reasoning in depth on the chosen path
`,
    example: `
Problem: Reduce cloud infrastructure costs by 30%

Generate three approaches:
A) Optimize existing architecture
B) Migrate services to cheaper providers
C) Redesign system boundaries

Evaluate each on cost reduction, risk, timeline, and engineering effort.
Select the best option and provide a detailed execution plan.

    description: `
The Feynman Technique forces clarity by requiring explanations that a beginner
could understand. If an explanation cannot be made simple, it usually means
the underlying understanding is incomplete.

This framework is powerful for teaching, learning, and testing comprehension.

      "Expert-to-expert communication",
      "Highly technical documentation",
      "Situations where precision matters more than intuition"

    structure: `
1. Explain the concept as if to a beginner
2. Avoid jargon or define it clearly
3. Use analogies and concrete examples
4. Build from first principles
`,
    example: `
Explain how large language models work as if you were teaching a curious 12-year-old.
Use everyday analogies, avoid technical jargon, and explain each idea before moving on.

  consistency: {
    framework: "Self-Consistency",
    title: "Accuracy through repetition",
    description: `
Self-Consistency improves reliability by leveraging variation. By generating multiple
independent answers to the same prompt and comparing them, you can identify consensus,
surface uncertainty, and reduce hallucinations.

This approach trades cost and speed for higher confidence.

      "Cost- or latency-sensitive workflows"
    ],
    structure: `
1. Ask the same question multiple times independently
2. Compare the results
3. Identify consensus and divergence
4. Flag uncertainty or investigate disagreements
`,
    example: `
Answer the following question 5 times independently:
"What is the CAGR given X, Y, and Z?"

Then:
- Identify the most common answer
- Explain any discrepancies
- State confidence level in the final result
